<ol>
 <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
 <li>Puree cauliflower in a food processor until finely ground.</li>
 <li>Cook ground cauliflower, water, and salt together in a skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant and most of the water evaporates, 5 to 6 minutes. Cool completely.</li>
